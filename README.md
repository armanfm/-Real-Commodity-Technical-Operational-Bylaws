# Real Commodity – Technical Operational Bylaws (Final Draft)

## Preamble
These bylaws establish the technical and operational rules for the RC – Real Commodity ecosystem, a token backed by physical commodities and designed for merit-based appreciation. The goal is to ensure transparency, security, fairness, and scalability, aligning incentives across all value-chain providers.

## Article 1 – Definitions and Core Concepts
- **1.1 RC (Real Commodity)** – Token backed by physical commodities (soy, coffee, meat, ethanol, etc.), whose value derives from the physical backing, provider merit, and the market dynamics of the ecosystem.  
- **1.2 Provider** – Any participant in the value chain except the final consumer (producer, distributor, wholesaler, retailer).  
- **1.3 Final Consumer** – The last link in the chain. Does not receive RC directly, but consumption is essential for overall appreciation.  
- **1.4 Surplus** – Sales volume (in kg) of a provider that exceeds its Audited Minimum Stock (AMS) during a defined period.  
- **1.5 Audited Minimum Stock (AMS)** – Minimum quantity of commodity recorded and audited on-chain. After the **first sale is verified by an official invoice**, the producer’s trust level is established. For subsequent shipments, proof via invoice is sufficient—no new physical audit is required.

---

## Article 2 – Appreciation Pillars
- **Individual Merit** – Provider performance, quality, and reliability.  
- **Ecosystem Consumption** – Circulation of RC among providers driven by physical sales.  
- **Surplus Generation** – Sales above the AMS that create global appreciation.

## Article 3 – Initial RC Supply and Allocation
Initial supply is distributed as follows:

| Category      | Percentage | Purpose |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Platform      | 20% | Operating costs, auditing, development. |
| Expansion     | 20% | Integration of new providers and commodities. |
| Producers     | 20% | Merit bonuses and provider rewards. |
| Reputation    | 20% | Merit-based distribution. |
| Reserve/Fund  | 20% | Crisis management, independent audits, long-term sustainability. |

## Article 4 – Ongoing Issuance and Distribution
### 4.1 Provider Reward
- Rate: **0.002 RC per kg** of commodity sold, with fractions calculated to three decimal places.  
- Automatically minted by smart contract at the time of a blockchain-registered sale.

### 4.2 Global Appreciation
- Formula: **ΔRC = (Total Surplus in kg) × K**  
- **K**: Initial constant of **0.001 RC/kg**, adjustable only through on-chain governance by RC holders.  
- Newly minted tokens are distributed according to Article 3.

---

## Article 5 – Merit System
- All providers start with a base weight of 1.  
- +5% weight for each criterion met:  
  - Recognized quality certification  
  - Verified secure transport protocols  
  - Formal guarantee for replacement of damaged lots  
  - Maintenance of AMS during the period  
- +5% extra for exceptional performance  
- Bonuses increase distribution share only; they do **not** inflate total supply.

---

## Article 6 – Stock and Surplus Rules
- AMS registration and initial audit are mandatory at the start of each cycle.  
- **Surplus = Total Sold in Period – AMS** (never negative).  
- No obligation to replenish stock to the AMS; appreciation depends on real growth.

---

## Article 7 – Transparency and Auditing
- **Blockchain**: All records public and immutable, with privacy layer for sensitive commercial data.  
- **Audits**: Independent audits at least quarterly, with random surprise checks. Auditing firm chosen by on-chain vote of RC holders.  
- **First Stock Verification**: The first stored batch must be validated by smart IoT sensors and a decentralized oracle, required **only until the first transaction is confirmed by invoice**.  
- **Penalties**:  
  - Immediate loss of merit bonuses  
  - Temporary or permanent suspension  
  - Automatic RC fines enforced via smart contract

---

## Article 8 – Auction System
- Dynamic auction or fixed-minimum price  
- Lot size limited to **max 10%** of circulating RC per event  
- **0.1% RC fee**, which is burned to reduce supply  
- Auction history and results public on-chain

---

## Article 9 – Governance and Jurisdiction
- Providers must undergo due diligence before registration  
- Amendments require on-chain governance with quorum of **30% of circulating RC**  
- **Jurisdiction**: São Paulo, Brazil, unless future on-chain governance adopts decentralized arbitration

## Key Enhancements from Portuguese Draft
- Clear translation of legal and technical terms  
- Consistent English crypto/financial vocabulary  
- Maintains governance, auditing, and IoT/oracle requirements exactly as specified
